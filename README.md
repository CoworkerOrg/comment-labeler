## What is this?
This is a Chrome extension we built at Coworker.org to create a labeled dataset for a wage theft classifier.

It injects a simple, two-button interface on top of Reddit comments that, when clicked, sends data about the comments to our Firebase database.

See [docs/](docs/) for instructions on setting up your own API keys and Firebase credentials.
